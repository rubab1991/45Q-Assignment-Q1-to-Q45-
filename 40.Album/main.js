// Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album.
//The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and 
//it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information.
//Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums.
//Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly.
//Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album 
// If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object.
//Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album
